## Neaxtjs, React -redux Boileplate

This project was bootstrapped with [Create Next App](https://github.com/segmentio/create-next-app).
Out of the box, we get:

- Automatic transpilation and bundling (with webpack and babel)
- Hot code reloading
- Server rendering and indexing of `./pages`
- Static file serving. `./static/` is mapped to `/static/`


In addition, I have added setup for:
- node / express customized server
- redux / redux-thunk / actions /reducers
- persistent storage of redux store across pages and browser refreshes
- material-ui (with customized theme)
- SASS
- service worker registration at root scope for offline capability
- module aliases (relative paths not needed in modules)
- file compression

## To Install
```
 npm install
 

 make it your own:
 git init
 git remote set-url origin http://github.com/[YOUR GITHUB NAME]/[YOUR GITHUB NEW REPOSITORY]

 test it out:
 npm run dev

```


## Folder Structure

After creating an app, it should look something like:

```
my-app/
  .next/
  actions/
  components/
  node_modules/
  offline/
  pages/
  reducers/
  static/
  styles/
  .babelrc
  .gitignore
  manifest.json
  my-service-worker.js
  next.config.js
  postcss.config.js
  routes.js
  server.js
  storage.js
  store.js
```

Routing in Next.js is based on the file system, so `./pages/index.js` maps to the `/` route and
`./pages/about.js` would map to `/about`.

The `./static` directory maps to `/static` in the `next` server, so you can put all your
other static resources like images or compiled CSS in there.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `.next` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run start`

Starts the application in production mode.
The application should be compiled with \`next build\` first.

See the section in Next docs about [deployment](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/wiki/Deployment) for more information.

## Page Template
There is a template file in the /pages section which is all set up.  Simply copy it and then you're good to go.  For further explantion, read on:

## Using SASS / CSS

Prefer to organize stylesheets this way:

- /styles/
  - all globally used and shared stylesheets go in here

- /components/MyComponent/
  - index.js -- component file
  - mycomponent.scss -- stylesheet for this specific component

Then, in the file for the actual component simply write:
```
import stylesheet from './mycomponent.scss';
```

...and at the bottom of the component  add this:
```
<style dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: stylesheet}}></style>
```
You can use @import '../someSassOrCssFile' as usual in any Sass file. (You must use relative paths though, unfortunately).  The Layout component,which is wrapped around each top-level page, has a corresponding stylesheet 'layout.scss'.  Here is where you would import any stylesheets to use globally.

## Using Material-UI
It's all set up as Higher Order Component (hoc).  To use it add this to a page (top-level only):
```
import withMui from 'components/hocs/withMui';
...
export default withMui(MyComponent);
```
The theme.js file under styles/ has a customized theme set up.  Here you can customize all the Material-UI components to your heart's content.  Simply find the component you want to change, uncomment it out and change it to the way you want it to be.

## Connecting to Redux Store
The store is all set up.   To use it add this to a page:
``` 
import withRedux from 'next-redux-wrapper';
import makeStore from '../store';
import * as actions from 'actions';
...

function mapStateToProps(state) {
  return (
    whatever: state.whatever
  );
}

export default withRedux(makeStore, mapStateToProps, actions)(withMui(App));
```

Then, you can either pass your props down to child components or connect your components to the store using the regular {connect} from react-redux, your choice.

## Persistent Storage
The redux store persists across pages and even browser refreshes. Simply wrap each top-level page in the Shell component:
```
<Layout>
... your page stuff
</Layout>
```
If you want something the user does to save to the store AND to the persistent storage, add syncStorage() to that code.  SyncStorage looks for the LATEST version of the store and makes sure the stored version and the one in the cache are the same.

In addition, make sure that each reducer you set up has the following code:
```
const s = require('actions/types').storage; //put this in every reducer

...

    //updates whole store -- put in every reducer with name of reducer
    case s.SET_STORE: 
      return action.payload.app ``{app is a reducer name}``;

```

Any time that you want to "age" the redux store to make sure that these values will be saved on the next syncStorage() action, either call the ageStore() action from storageActions after you update that value in store, or update the 'updated' value directly to Date.now() if you are in the appReducer.

## Module aliases
I don't like using relative paths if I don't have to (I hate trying to remember ../../..)!  So I set up in the .babelrc file at the root all the aliases for different folders.  If you add a folder to your project, add it in there too.

## Service Worker
 set up a service worker at root (my-service-worker-simple.js).
1. Any time that you add a page, add the url to the cache of the my-service-worker.js file in the install event and change the version number.
2. Be sure to customize the manifest.json file at the root with your project specifics, such as your project name and icons.
